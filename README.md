# Conway's Game of Life - Python Visualization

This repository contains a Python implementation of **Conway's Game of Life**, a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. The simulation evolves over a 20x20 grid for a user-defined number of generations, with visualization provided as both a static image and an animated `.gif`.

## Features

- 20x20 toroidal (wrapping) grid
- Initial configuration (glider pattern)
- Can change the configuration in (`initializegame()`)
- Step-by-step evolution based on Game of Life rules
- Animated output (`game_of_life.gif`)
- Static snapshot of the final generation (`game_of_life.png`)
